<h3>About Javascript</h3>

<p>Javascript is one of the most popular and widely used languages in the world.</p>

<p>For a long time Javascript was only used in browsers used to build interactive webpages. Some people referred to it as a toy language.</p>

<p> Javascript was originally built to run in browser. Browsers have a JS engine to run this code. For example Firefox uses Spidermonkey and chrome uses v8. Node is a c++ program that includes Chrome's v8 engine. With this we can run JS code outside of a browser. So we can pass JS code to node and execute it. This allows us to build the backend for mobile and web applications.</p>

<p>ECMAScript is the defining standards or rules on how you write JS. v.1 was created in 1997 and in 2015
ES6 has came out and this version defined many new features for JS.</p>

<p>Let's talk about variables</p>

<p>We use a <strong>variable</strong> to store data temporarily in the computers memory. We store that data somewhere and give that memory location a name. With this name, we can read the data at the location later. A variable is like a box what we put in the box is the value we assign to the variable in other words the variable. The label is the name of the box or in this case the name of a variable.</p>
