// using node commonjs modules
// we can run this code in terminal by typing node (name of file)

// we want to modularize this simple program
// a basic rule of thumb about modularity
// "things that are highly related should go together" this is called cohesion in software engineering
// the same concept applies to code

// Lets take the weakmap and the object and place them into a new file called circle.js
// first we are going to copy and cut the code from here


const c = new Circle(10);
c.draw();
