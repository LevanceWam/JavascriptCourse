// Exercise
// Design a stopwatch obj
// when we define a new const and set it to stopwatch
// in that stopwatch we have a few members 
// duration this is a property
// reset method
// start method
// stop method

// intitally duration is 0
// we can start the watch
// it we do it again it will throw an error

// we can call stop but just like start if it already is at stop
// yell at us

// when we call duration after stop it should show us the seconds that have passed 
// reset sets us back to 0

function Stopwatch() {
    let startTime, endTime, running, duration = 0;

    this.startTime = function () {
        if ()
    };
    this.endTime = function () {

    };
    this.reset = function () {

    };
