// Primitive types
// In JS we have 2 types Primitives and Reference types we will look at the latter of the 2 later on
// some primitives we have are:
/*
String
Number
Boolean
Undefined
Null
*/
let name1 = 'vance'; // This is a string or string literal
let age1 = 25; // Number literal
let isApproved1 = false; // Boolean literal
let firstName1 = undefined; // we can also just leave this blank
let selectColor1 = null; // Used when we explicitly want to clear the value of a variable.
// so in the future if we make a color picker and the user chooses red then it will change to red.
